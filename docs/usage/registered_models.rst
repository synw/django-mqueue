Registered models
=================

.. highlight:: python

Models can be registered. They will be automatically monitored.

Autoregister a model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In ``settings.py``:

::

   MQUEUE_AUTOREGISTER = (
   	('django.contrib.auth.models.User', ["c", "d", "u"]),
   	('emailmodule.models.Email', ["c", "d"])
   	)

The registered models will be monitored according to the chosen monitoring level: 

``c``: create

``d``: delete

``u``: upgrade

Manualy register a model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In any installed app ``apps.py`` :

::

   from django.apps import AppConfig
   
   class MyappConfig(AppConfig):
       name = "myapp"
       verbose_name = "My app"
       
       def ready(self):
           from mqueue.tracking import mqueue_tracker
           from myapp.models import TheModel
    
           mqueue_tracker.register(TheModel)


By default this will records create and delete events. To change it set a parameter:

::

   mqueue_tracker.register(TheModel, ["c", "u", "d"])
   
   
Settings
^^^^^^^^

To disable events recording in the database for some models:

::

   MQUEUE_NOSAVE = ["Model1", "Model2"]
