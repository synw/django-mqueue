# Logs handler

Mqueue has a log handler that to stores the django logs into the db as events.

To enable it add this to `settings.py`

```python
from mqueue.logging import LOGGING
```

This will enable logging on `ERROR` level when `DEBUG` is False. To log on `WARNING` level (which also handles the the 404 errors and friends) do this:

```python
from mqueue.logging import LOGGING_WARNING as LOGGING
```

To enable logging in dev mode, when `DEBUG` is True or False (useful to debug some ajax for example):

```python
from mqueue.logging import DEV_LOGGING as LOGGING
```
