# Registered models

Models can be registered. They will be automatically monitored and some events will be generated

## Autoregister a model

In `settings.py`:

```python
MQUEUE_AUTOREGISTER = (
    ('django.contrib.auth.models.User', ["c", "d", "u"]),
    ('myapp.models.MyModel', ["c", "d"])
)
```

The registered models will be generate events according to the chosen monitoring level:

- <kbd>c</kbd>: create
- <kbd>d</kbd>: delete
- <kbd>u</kbd>: upgrade

## Manualy register a model

In any installed app `apps.py`:

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig

class MyappConfig(AppConfig):
    name = "myapp"
    verbose_name = "My app"

    def ready(self):
        from mqueue.tracking import mqueue_tracker
        from myapp.models import TheModel

        mqueue_tracker.register(TheModel)
```

By default this will records create and delete events. To change it set a parameter:

```python
mqueue_tracker.register(TheModel, ["c", "u", "d"])
```

## Settings

To disable events recording in the database for some models:

```python
MQUEUE_NOSAVE = ["Model1", "Model2"]
```
